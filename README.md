# hello-world

I am Nicolas, a physicist who specialized in astronomy but that now is learning data science from the ground up. Besides science, I enjoy practicing creative activities such as realistic drawing and playing piano. I also really like animals, specially I am fond of dogs and dog training.

Thank you for reading!
